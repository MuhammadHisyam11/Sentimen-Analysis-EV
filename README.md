👋 Hi There 👋

>Description:
❗This is my thesis for educational only❗
i want to predict Analysis Sentimen for electric car vehicle in Indonesia.
i use dataset from twitter by scraping it on google colabs.
The Algorithm i use is Naive Bayes and Random Forest.

What i used 💻 :
◽ Python 🐍
◽ Flask
◽ Jupyter Notebook
◽ VsCode
◽ Google Colabs

If you want to use datasets 📚 :
Notebook > Data > Mobil Listrik.css / Mobil Listrik no_label.csv
Notebook > Data > key_norm.csv

You can clone this repository and use it
I'm recommend you to use VsCode

First of all, you need to knew step by step to use flask 😎:
1. Download virtualenv python on your terminal
2. Run the following command "pip install virtualenv env"
3. Run the following command "./env/Scripts/Activate.ps1" 🎞 If you can't activate watch this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVms4oi-MQk&t=198s and reactivate it.
4. Run the following command "cd my_flask_app"
5. Run the following command "python app.py"
Note:
◽ If number 5 can't run you must download the following error message in your terminal
Example:
◽ If error message is pickle not found or something like that you must install it "pip install pickle" on your terminal.
